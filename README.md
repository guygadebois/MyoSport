# MyoSport

MyoSport is a project of online classifying sport gestures with the
MYO Armband (https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/).

This project is in a R&D state. I'm developing a classifier machine learning
system. But I still don't know if MYO's raw data will be consistant enought
for making this classifier work.

Be patient, the answer will come soon !
